Communication is the process of sharing information, ideas, or feelings between people. It can be verbal, using spoken or written words, or non-verbal, through body language, gestures, and facial expressions. Effective communication is important because it helps build relationships, resolve conflicts, and achieve goals in both personal and professional settings. Listening actively, expressing thoughts clearly, and being aware of the tone and context are key elements of good communication. Whether it's face-to-face, over the phone, or through digital platforms, communication plays a vital role in connecting people and fostering understanding.
